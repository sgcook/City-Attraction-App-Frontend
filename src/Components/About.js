        Greetings, traveller! CityWalk is an app that plans your walking tour of
        the city, with suggestions for eating, drinking and sightseeing thrown
        in. Tell us when you're visiting, what you'd like to see, your favourite
        cuisine and how far you'd like to walk, and we'll design your perfect
        day out. And if you're feeling spontaneous or can't decide, press the
        Wildcard button for a random tour.
      </p>
